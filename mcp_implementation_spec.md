Based on my research, I'll provide information about MCP servers for document serving and the cursor error you're experiencing.
MCP Servers for Document Serving
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that serve documents should include these key tools:
Document Retrieval Tools:
Tools to fetch and read document content
Search functionality within documents
Support for different document formats
Document Processing Tools:
Text extraction and parsing
Semantic search capabilities
Context-aware document navigation
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Capabilities:
Vector-based document search
Embedding generation for document chunks
Relevance ranking for search results
Document Management Tools:
List available documents
Extract metadata from documents
Organize document collections
Security Features:
Input validation for document paths
Access control for sensitive documents
Proper error handling
Examples of effective MCP document servers include:
RAG Documentation MCP Server - Provides vector search capabilities for documentation retrieval
Package Documentation MCP Server - Offers structured access to package documentation across programming languages
MCP Documentation Server - Enables integration between LLM applications and documentation sources
Cursor Error: "Client Closed" Issue
The error you're seeing:
Apply
This is related to:
Node.js Experimental Warning: The error is about using deprecated importAssertions syntax instead of the newer importAttributes in JavaScript modules. This is a Node.js warning, not a critical error.
Common in Cursor and VS Code: This warning appears in several Cursor forum posts and is related to the VS Code-based architecture that Cursor uses.
Not Critical: This is a warning rather than an error, and shouldn't prevent Cursor from functioning properly.
Similar Issues: Other users have reported this warning in combination with marketplace extension issues or model refresh problems.
Possible Solutions:
This warning can typically be ignored as it's about future deprecation
If you're experiencing actual functionality issues, try restarting Cursor
For persistent problems, updating Cursor to the latest version might help
The warning can be suppressed by using the suggested --trace-warnings flag if needed
The warning is informing developers that the code is using a JavaScript feature that will be changing in the future, but it shouldn't impact normal operation of Cursor.
based on your findings, analyze my main.py server section and look at my tutorial output and the document inside, tell me what type of tools i need to employ on my mcp implementation for serving these documents in a machine readable format for reverse engineering the blue prints on those documents

I'll need to examine your main.py server section and tutorial output to provide specific recommendations for your MCP implementation. Let me take a look at your files first.
Let me examine your main.py file to understand the server section:
Let me look at the tutorial output directory to understand the document structure:
Let me examine the MCP server specification and code:
Let me also check the index file and a sample chapter to understand the document structure:
<no message>
Based on the analysis of your code and tutorial output, I can provide recommendations for MCP tools needed to effectively serve your tutorial documents in a machine-readable format for reverse engineering blueprints.
MCP Tools You Should Implement
Document Structure Analysis Tools
analyze_document_structure: Parse markdown files to extract headings, sections, and code blocks
extract_code_samples: Pull out code snippets with language identification
generate_document_outline: Create hierarchical representation of document structure
Blueprint Extraction Tools
extract_component_diagrams: Identify React component hierarchies from documentation

extract_api_interfaces: Identify API interfaces and data structures
Code Pattern Recognition Tools
identify_design_patterns: Detect common software design patterns in code samples
extract_function_signatures: Parse and categorize function definitions
analyze_dependencies: Map relationships between components/modules
Semantic Understanding Tools

related_concepts: Find related technical concepts within documentation
technical_glossary: Extract and define technical terms used in the documentation
Interactive Documentation Tools
interactive_code_playground: Allow testing code snippets from documentation
visual_component_explorer: Interactive visualization of component relationships
step_by_step_tutorial_navigator: Guide through implementation steps
Implementation Approach
Your current MCP implementation is basic, serving markdown files via HTTP endpoints. To enhance it for reverse engineering purposes, I recommend:
Extend Your MCP Specification:
   tools:
     - name: analyze_document_structure

       endpoint: /analyze/structure
       method: POST

         properties:
           chapterNum:

             description: Chapter number to analyze
         required: [chapterNum]
       outputSchema:

       outputSchema:
         type: array
         
     - name: extract_component_diagrams
       description: Extracts React component hierarchies
       endpoint: /extract/components
       method: GET
       outputSchema:
         type: object


Enhance Your Server Implementation:
   def analyze_document_structure(self, chapter_num):
       # Load chapter content
       chapter_content = self._load_chapter(chapter_num)
       
       # Parse markdown structure
       structure = {
           "headings": self._extract_headings(chapter_content),
           "sections": self._extract_sections(chapter_content),
           "codeBlocks": self._extract_code_blocks(chapter_content)
       }
       
       return structure
       
   def extract_code_samples(self, chapter_num, language=None):
       # Load chapter content
       chapter_content = self._load_chapter(chapter_num)
       
       # Extract code blocks with language info
       code_blocks = self._extract_code_blocks(chapter_content)
       
       # Filter by language if specified
       if language:
           code_blocks = [block for block in code_blocks if block["language"] == language]
           
       return code_blocks
       
   def extract_component_diagrams(self):
       # Analyze all chapters to find component relationships
       components = {}
       for chapter in self._get_all_chapters():
           # Extract component definitions
           chapter_components = self._extract_components(chapter["content"])
           components.update(chapter_components)
           
       # Build relationship graph
       component_graph = self._build_component_graph(components)
       
       return component_graph


Add Document Processing Functions:
   def _extract_headings(self, content):
       """Extract all headings with their levels and positions"""
       import re
       heading_pattern = r'^(#{1,6})\s+(.+?)$'
       headings = []
       
       for i, line in enumerate(content.split('\n')):
           match = re.match(heading_pattern, line)
           if match:
               level = len(match.group(1))
               text = match.group(2)
               headings.append({
                   "level": level,
                   "text": text,
                   "line": i
               })
               
       return headings
       
   def _extract_code_blocks(self, content):
       """Extract code blocks with language information"""
       import re
       code_block_pattern = r'```(\w+)?\n(.*?)\n```'
       code_blocks = []
       
       for match in re.finditer(code_block_pattern, content, re.DOTALL):
           language = match.group(1) or "text"
           code = match.group(2)
           code_blocks.append({
               "language": language,
               "code": code
           })
               
       return code_blocks



Add React Component Analysis:
   def _extract_components(self, content):
       """Extract React component definitions"""
       import re
       # Pattern for React functional components
       func_component_pattern = r'(export\s+)?const\s+(\w+)\s*:\s*React\.FC.*?='
       # Pattern for React class components
       class_component_pattern = r'(export\s+)?class\s+(\w+)\s+extends\s+React\.Component'
       
       components = {}
       
       # Find functional components
       for match in re.finditer(func_component_pattern, content):
           name = match.group(2)
           components[name] = {"type": "functional"}
           
       # Find class components
       for match in re.finditer(class_component_pattern, content):
           name = match.group(2)
           components[name] = {"type": "class"}
           
       return components
