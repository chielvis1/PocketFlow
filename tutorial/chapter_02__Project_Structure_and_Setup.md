# Chapter 2: Project Structure and Setup

Welcome to Chapter 2! Now that we have a high-level understanding of the core concepts and components involved in our mapping application, it's time to get our hands dirty. This chapter will guide you through setting up the project environment, understanding the directory structure, and getting the application running locally.

By the end of this chapter, you will have cloned the repository, installed the necessary dependencies, configured your Google Maps API key, and started the development server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher (recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **npm, yarn, or pnpm:** A package manager. npm is included with Node.js.
3.  **Git:** For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
4.  **A Code Editor:** Such as VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.
5.  **A Google Cloud Account and API Key:** You'll need a Google Maps JavaScript API key and a Places API key. Ensure billing is enabled (though Google provides a free tier). You can obtain and manage keys from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

## Getting the Code

The first step is to obtain the project code. We'll use Git to clone the repository.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3.  Run the following command, replacing `[Repository URL]` with the actual URL of the project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [Repository URL]
    ```
4.  Navigate into the cloned project directory:

    ```bash
    cd [project-directory-name]
    ```

## Installing Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, you need to install all the required libraries and packages. This project uses npm as the package manager in its examples, but you can substitute `yarn` or `pnpm` if you prefer.

Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the listed dependencies into the `node_modules` folder.

## Setting up Environment Variables

Google Maps APIs require an API key for authentication and usage tracking. For security reasons, API keys should never be hardcoded directly into your application's source code. Instead, we use environment variables.

This project, being a Next.js application, uses the built-in support for environment variables via `.env` files.

1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` at the root of your project directory.
2.  Open the `.env.local` file in your code editor.
3.  Add the following line, replacing `[Your Google Maps API Key]` with the API key you obtained from the Google Cloud Console:

    ```dotenv
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=[Your Google Maps API Key]
    ```

    *Note: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is crucial in Next.js. It makes the environment variable available to the browser-side code, which is necessary for loading the Google Maps JavaScript API.*

## Understanding the Project Structure

Let's take a brief look at the key directories and files you'll encounter, based on the project context provided.

```
/
├── .env.local         # Your environment variables (API key goes here)
├── node_modules       # Installed dependencies (created by npm install)
├── app/               # Next.js App Router directory
│   ├── page.tsx       # The main application page component
│   └── components/    # Directory for reusable React components
│       └── PlacesAutocomplete.tsx # Component for location search input
├── public/            # Static assets (e.g., favicon, images)
├── package.json       # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json      # TypeScript configuration
└── ...other files (git ignore, README, etc.)
```

Here's a breakdown of the important parts:

*   **`.env.local`**: Stores your sensitive configuration like the API key.
*   **`app/`**: This is the heart of the application using Next.js's App Router.
    *   **`app/page.tsx`**: This file acts as the main entry point and layout for our application's primary page. It's where the main components like the `GoogleMap` and `PlacesAutocomplete` are orchestrated and rendered.
    *   **`app/components/`**: This directory contains reusable React components.
        *   **`PlacesAutocomplete.tsx`**: As analyzed in the context, this is a specific component responsible for rendering the search input field and handling the location autocomplete functionality using the `@react-google-maps/api/dist/components/places-autocomplete/PlacesAutocomplete` library component. It likely takes user input and provides suggested place names.
*   **`node_modules/`**: Contains all the libraries installed by `npm install`.
*   **`package.json`**: Defines the project, its scripts (like starting the development server), and its dependencies (including `@react-google-maps/api`, React, etc.).

Based on the relationships context, `app/page.tsx` imports and uses `app/components/PlacesAutocomplete.tsx`, demonstrating a hierarchical relationship where the main page component utilizes a smaller, specialized component for a specific part of the UI (the search bar). `app/page.tsx` also directly interacts with the core mapping library (`@react-google-maps/api`) to render the map and markers.

## Running the Project

With the dependencies installed and the environment variable set, you can now start the development server.

Run the following command in your terminal from the project root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Next.js development server. You should see output indicating the server is starting, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should now see the application running! If you've configured the API key correctly and the basic structure is in place, you might see a map or an interface waiting for input.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, you've successfully set up the project environment. You cloned the code, installed the necessary packages, configured your Google Maps API key using environment variables, and explored the basic project structure, understanding the roles of `app/page.tsx` and `app/components/PlacesAutocomplete.tsx`. You also learned how to start the development server and run the application locally.

Now that the project is set up, we are ready to dive deeper into the code and understand how the different components work together to create the mapping application. In the next chapter, we will focus on loading and displaying the basic map.
