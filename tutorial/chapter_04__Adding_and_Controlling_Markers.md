# Chapter 4: Adding and Controlling Markers

Now that we have a functioning map displayed, the next crucial step is to make it interactive and informative. One of the most common ways to do this is by adding markers to highlight specific locations. In this chapter, we'll learn how to add markers using the `@react-google-maps/api` library and, importantly, how to control their position dynamically based on user interaction, specifically the location selected from our autocomplete search box.

## What is a Marker?

Think of a marker as a digital pin you place on a map. It's a visual icon that sits precisely at a given geographical coordinate (latitude and longitude). Markers are essential for:

*   Pointing out points of interest (like a business location, a landmark, etc.).
*   Indicating a user's selected location.
*   Showing the result of a search.

In our application, we want a marker to appear at the location the user selects using the `PlacesAutocomplete` component.

## Adding a Basic Marker with `@react-google-maps/api`

The `@react-google-maps/api` library provides a dedicated component for adding markers: `MarkerF`. (The `F` stands for Functional Component, indicating it's designed to work well within React functional components).

Like the `GoogleMap` component, `MarkerF` is rendered as a child *inside* the `GoogleMap` component. Its most essential prop is `position`, which requires an object with `lat` and `lng` properties, just like our `center` state.

To add a static marker, you would place `MarkerF` inside `GoogleMap`:

```jsx
// Inside your GoogleMap component in app/page.tsx
<GoogleMap
  // ... other props like center, zoom, onLoad
>
  {/* This marker would always be at Times Square */}
  <MarkerF position={{ lat: 40.7580, lng: -73.9855 }} />
</GoogleMap>
```

This is useful for fixed locations, but our goal is to display a marker at the *selected* location.

## Controlling Marker Position with State

Our application uses the `selected` state variable (managed by `useState` in `app/page.tsx`) to store the coordinates of the location chosen by the user via the `PlacesAutocomplete` component. This provides the perfect mechanism to control the marker's position dynamically.

Here's the plan:

1.  We will use the `MarkerF` component.
2.  We will set its `position` prop to the value of our `selected` state.
3.  We will only render the `MarkerF` component if the `selected` state is *not* null, meaning a location has actually been chosen.

Let's look at the relevant part of `app/page.tsx`:

```jsx
'use client';

import { useState, useMemo, useCallback, useRef } from 'react';
import { GoogleMap, MarkerF, useLoadScript, CircleF, DirectionsRendererF } from '@react-google-maps/api'; // Import MarkerF
import PlacesAutocomplete from './components/PlacesAutocomplete'; // Assuming this is the correct path

type LatLngLiteral = google.maps.LatLngLiteral;
type DirectionsResult = google.maps.DirectionsResult;
type MapOptions = google.maps.MapOptions;

// ... (rest of your component and hooks)

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded } = useLoadScript({
    googleMapsApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY as string,
    libraries: ['places'],
  });

  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<LatLngLiteral | null>(null); // State to hold selected location

  // ... (center state, mapOptions, mapRef, etc.)

  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div className='flex flex-col items-center w-screen h-screen p-4'>
      <div className='w-full max-w-xl z-10'>
        <PlacesAutocomplete
          onSelect={(coordinates) => {
            setSelected(coordinates); // Update selected state
            // Optionally, pan the map to the selected location
            mapRef.current?.panTo(coordinates);
            mapRef.current?.setZoom(15); // Maybe zoom in a bit
          }}
        />
      </div>

      <GoogleMap
        mapContainerClassName='w-full h-full mt-4'
        center={center} // Map center might initially be different, but we pan to selected
        zoom={10}
        options={mapOptions}
        onLoad={onLoad}
        onDblClick={onDblClick} // Example event handler
      >
        {/* Render the MarkerF only if 'selected' has a value */}
        {selected && <MarkerF position={selected} />}

        {/* Add other map components like CircleF or DirectionsRendererF here if needed */}
        {/* {circle && <CircleF center={circle.center} radius={circle.radius} options={circleOptions} />} */}
        {/* {directions && <DirectionsRendererF directions={directions} />} */}

      </GoogleMap>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`useState<LatLngLiteral | null>(null)`:** The `selected` state is initialized to `null`. It will hold the `{ lat, lng }` object when a place is selected, or remain `null` if no place is selected yet or the input is cleared.
2.  **`PlacesAutocomplete onSelect`:** When the `PlacesAutocomplete` component successfully finds coordinates for a selected place, it calls the `onSelect` prop, passing the coordinates. Our handler function updates the `selected` state using `setSelected(coordinates)`.
3.  **`{selected && <MarkerF position={selected} />}`:** This is a common React pattern for conditional rendering.
    *   `selected && ...` means "If `selected` is truthy (i.e., not `null` or `undefined`), then evaluate the expression after `&&`".
    *   If `selected` is `null` (initially or after clearing the input), the expression stops, and the `MarkerF` component is *not* rendered.
    *   If `selected` holds a `{ lat, lng }` object, the expression continues, and the `<MarkerF ... />` component is rendered.
4.  **`position={selected}`:** When the `MarkerF` is rendered, its `position` prop is set directly to the value of the `selected` state.

Now, whenever the `selected` state updates (because the user picks a place from the autocomplete suggestions), React re-renders the `app/page.tsx` component. If `selected` has a value, the `MarkerF` component is included in the render output with its `position` prop set to the new coordinates, causing a marker to appear or move to the selected location on the map.

## Customizing Markers (Optional)

The `MarkerF` component accepts many other props to customize its appearance and behavior:

*   `icon`: Change the default marker icon.
*   `title`: Add tooltip text that appears when hovering over the marker.
*   `onClick`: Add a click event handler to the marker.
*   `draggable`: Make the marker draggable by the user.

For example, to add a title and a simple click handler:

```jsx
{selected && (
  <MarkerF
    position={selected}
    title="Selected Location"
    onClick={() => alert('Marker Clicked!')}
  />
)}
```

While our current application primarily focuses on placing a single marker based on search input, understanding these options allows for richer map interactions in the future.

## Conclusion

Adding and controlling markers is fundamental to building interactive map applications. By leveraging the `MarkerF` component from `@react-google-maps/api` and connecting its `position` prop to our application's state (`selected`), we can dynamically display and move a marker based on user input from the `PlacesAutocomplete`. This makes our map respond directly to the user's search, providing clear visual feedback.

In the next chapter, we might explore other ways to interact with the map, such as drawing shapes or calculating routes between locations, further enhancing the application's functionality.
