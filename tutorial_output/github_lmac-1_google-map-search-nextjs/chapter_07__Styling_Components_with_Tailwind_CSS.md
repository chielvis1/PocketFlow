# Chapter 7: Styling Components with Tailwind CSS

In this chapter, we’ll explore how to leverage **Tailwind CSS** to style your Next.js components effectively. Tailwind provides a utility-first approach to CSS, allowing you to rapidly build responsive and customizable interfaces without leaving your markup. We will cover applying Tailwind utility classes throughout the components in our project, extending Tailwind’s default theme for customization, optimizing styles by purging unused CSS for performance, and combining Tailwind with component logic to achieve dynamic styling.

## 7.1 Introduction to Tailwind CSS in Our Project

Tailwind CSS is already configured in this Next.js repository, providing a rich set of utility classes that can be directly applied to JSX elements. This approach aligns well with React’s component-driven paradigm, enabling you to style elements inline with clean, semantic markup.

Using Tailwind, you can:

- Build **responsive layouts** with minimal effort using breakpoint prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.).
- Customize colors, fonts, spacing, and more by extending Tailwind’s default theme.
- Write **dynamic styles** that respond to component state or props.
- Optimize your final CSS bundle by purging unused styles, improving load times.

## 7.2 Applying Tailwind Utility Classes in Components

Tailwind’s core strength lies in applying small, composable utility classes directly on elements.

### Example: Styling a Search Input with Autocomplete

Suppose we have a `SearchInput.tsx` component that integrates Google Places Autocomplete. Here’s a typical example of applying Tailwind classes:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface SearchInputProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (val: string) => void;
}

const SearchInput: React.FC<SearchInputProps> = ({ value, onChange }) => {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={value}
      onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Search places..."
      className="
        w-full
        px-4
        py-2
        border
        border-gray-300
        rounded-md
        focus:outline-none
        focus:ring-2
        focus:ring-blue-500
        transition
        duration-150
        ease-in-out
        "
    />
  );
};

export default SearchInput;
```

#### Explanation:

- `w-full`: Makes the input span the full width of its container.
- `px-4 py-2`: Adds horizontal and vertical padding.
- `border border-gray-300 rounded-md`: Adds a subtle border with rounded corners.
- `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`: Adds a blue ring on focus for accessibility and visual feedback.
- `transition duration-150 ease-in-out`: Smooth animation on focus changes.

### Responsive Styling Example

To make components adapt to different screen sizes, use Tailwind’s responsive prefixes:

```tsx
<div className="p-4 sm:p-6 md:p-8 lg:p-10">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

- Padding increases with larger breakpoints: `p-4` by default, `p-6` on small screens (`sm`), and so forth.

## 7.3 Extending Tailwind Themes and Customization

While Tailwind comes with a sensible default theme, you often want to add project-specific colors, fonts, or spacing scales. This is done in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Example: Adding Custom Colors

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brandBlue: '#1DA1F2',
        brandGray: '#657786',
      },
      spacing: {
        '72': '18rem',
        '84': '21rem',
      },
    },
  },
  // other config options...
};
```

Now, in your components, you can use these custom utilities:

```tsx
<button className="bg-brandBlue text-white px-6 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  Search
</button>
```

### Why Extend?

- **Consistency:** Maintain a design system with consistent colors and spacing.
- **Scalability:** Easily update styles globally by modifying the config.
- **Reusability:** Avoid repeating raw values across your codebase.

## 7.4 Purging Unused Styles for Performance

Tailwind generates a large CSS file by default, but Next.js and Tailwind’s standard setup include a purge step to remove unused styles in production.

### How It Works

- Tailwind scans your source files (`.tsx`, `.js`, `.html`, etc.) looking for class names.
- Any classes not found in your source are removed from the final CSS bundle.
- This drastically reduces the CSS size, improving page load times.

### Configuration Example

In `tailwind.config.js`, the `content` field specifies which files Tailwind should scan:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',  // Next.js 13 app directory
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    // add other folders as needed
  ],
  // ...
};
```

### Tips for Purging

- Avoid dynamically constructing class names as strings since Tailwind cannot detect them.
- Use libraries like [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) or [`classnames`](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) to conditionally apply classes safely.

## 7.5 Combining Tailwind with Component Logic for Dynamic Styling

Tailwind works great with JavaScript logic to dynamically toggle styles based on component state or props.

### Example: Dynamic Button Disabled State

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import clsx from 'clsx';

interface ButtonProps {
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ disabled, onClick, children }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
      className={clsx(
        'px-4 py-2 rounded font-semibold transition-colors duration-150',
        disabled
          ? 'bg-gray-300 cursor-not-allowed text-gray-600'
          : 'bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white'
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

#### Explanation:

- We use `clsx` to conditionally apply classes based on the `disabled` prop.
- When disabled, the button has muted colors and a not-allowed cursor.
- When enabled, it shows vibrant blue and supports hover styles.

### Example: Responsive Layout with Conditional Classes

```tsx
<div className={clsx('p-4', isMobile ? 'bg-white' : 'bg-gray-100')}>
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

This enables combining Tailwind’s utility classes with React’s powerful logic for flexible UI.
