# Chapter 1: Introduction to the Project and Architectural Overview

## 1.1 Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial! In this chapter, we will introduce the core goals of the project and provide a high-level architectural overview. This project is a modern web application built using **Next.js 13+**, which integrates **Google Maps** with **Places Autocomplete** functionality. The app demonstrates how to leverage the latest Next.js features, including the new `app/` directory structure, React Server and Client Components, and utility-first styling with **Tailwind CSS**.

By the end of this chapter, you will understand the key technologies, architectural patterns, and project structure that form the foundation of this repository. This knowledge will prepare you to dive deeper into the codebase and extend the application as needed.

---

## 1.2 Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Build a performant, SEO-friendly React web app using Next.js 13’s `app/` directory.**
- **Integrate Google Maps and Places Autocomplete APIs to provide location search and map visualization.**
- **Demonstrate the use of React Server Components alongside Client Components to optimize rendering and data fetching.**
- **Use Tailwind CSS combined with PostCSS for fast, responsive, and maintainable styling.**

---

## 1.3 Next.js 13+ and the `app/` Directory Structure

Next.js 13 introduced a new way to organize your application using the `app/` directory, which coexists with or replaces the traditional `pages/` directory. This new structure brings several benefits:

- **File-based routing with enhanced layouts:** Routes are defined by folders and files inside `app/`, e.g., `app/page.tsx` for the home page.
- **Nested layouts and templates:** You can define reusable layouts (`layout.tsx`) that wrap pages, enabling consistent UI structures.
- **Server Components by default:** Components under `app/` are React Server Components unless marked otherwise.

### Example: Basic `app/` directory layout

```
app/
├── layout.tsx         # Root layout wrapping all pages
├── page.tsx           # Home page component
├── map/
│   ├── page.tsx       # Map page
│   └── layout.tsx     # Optional nested layout for map routes
└── components/
    ├── Map.tsx        # Client component for rendering Google Map
    └── SearchBox.tsx  # Client component for Places Autocomplete
```

---

## 1.4 React Server Components vs Client Components

Next.js 13 leverages **React Server Components (RSC)** to enable rendering parts of the UI on the server, which can improve performance and reduce client-side JavaScript bundle sizes.

- **Server Components:**
  - Rendered on the server.
  - Can fetch data directly without incurring client-side bundle cost.
  - Cannot use browser-only APIs (e.g., `window`, `document`).
  - Default component type in the `app/` directory.

- **Client Components:**
  - Rendered on the client.
  - Can use React state, effects, browser APIs.
  - Must be explicitly marked with `"use client";` directive at the top of the file.

### Example: Declaring a Client Component

```tsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function SearchBox() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={query}
      onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Search places..."
    />
  );
}
```

### How This Project Uses Server and Client Components

- **Server Components:** Used for layout, page structure, and data fetching where possible.
- **Client Components:** Used for interactive elements such as the Google Maps rendering and the autocomplete input, which require access to the browser environment.

---

## 1.5 Tailwind CSS and PostCSS Integration

Styling in this project uses **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to style your application using predefined classes directly in your markup.

- Tailwind promotes rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS.
- The project uses **PostCSS** to process Tailwind directives and apply vendor prefixes, ensuring compatibility across browsers.

### Tailwind Example

```tsx
<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4">
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Welcome to the Map App</h1>
  <p className="text-gray-600">Search for places and explore the map below.</p>
</div>
```

The above snippet centers content with padding, sets a large bold heading, and styles paragraph text with a muted color — all without writing any custom CSS.

---

## 1.6 Google Maps and Places Autocomplete Integration

A key feature of this project is the integration of Google Maps and the Places Autocomplete API, which allows users to search for locations with suggestions and see them on an interactive map.

- The **Google Maps JavaScript API** is loaded in a Client Component that renders the map.
- The **Places Autocomplete API** is used in a controlled input box that suggests places as the user types.
- The app manages API keys and loading scripts efficiently to maintain performance and best practices.

---

## 2.1 Introduction

This project uses **Next.js** (v13+) as the React framework, along with **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling, and **PostCSS** for CSS transformations. Tailwind CSS’s Just-in-Time (JIT) mode enhances developer experience by generating styles on demand, making builds faster and smaller.

The configuration files we will focus on are:

- `tailwind.config.ts` — Tailwind CSS configuration  
- `postcss.config.js` — PostCSS plugins and setup  
- `next.config.js` — Next.js core configuration  

Understanding and properly setting up these files ensures your styling and build process works seamlessly.

---

## 2.2 Configuring Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom designs. The configuration file `tailwind.config.ts` is where you customize the default Tailwind setup.

### Key Points in Tailwind Config:

- **`content`**: Specifies all the files Tailwind scans for class names to generate styles (critical for JIT).  
- **`theme`**: Customize colors, fonts, spacing, and extend the default theme.  
- **`plugins`**: Add Tailwind plugins for additional utilities or components.

### Example: `tailwind.config.ts`

```ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',  // Includes Next.js app directory files
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#1D4ED8',   // Custom primary color
        secondary: '#9333EA',
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
  mode: 'jit',  // Enables Just-In-Time mode for fast builds and on-demand styles
};

export default config;
```

### Explanation:

- The `content` array tells Tailwind to scan all `.tsx` and `.ts` files in the `app` and `components` folders to detect used classes and generate CSS accordingly.
- Extending the theme customizes default styles without overriding Tailwind’s core.
- Enabling `mode: 'jit'` activates Just-In-Time compilation, producing only the CSS you need, improving performance.

---

## 2.3 Setting Up PostCSS

PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. Tailwind CSS uses PostCSS under the hood to process its directives like `@tailwind base;`.

### `postcss.config.js` Example

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

### Explanation:

- **`tailwindcss` plugin**: Processes Tailwind’s directives and utilities.  
- **`autoprefixer` plugin**: Adds vendor prefixes automatically for broader browser support.

This minimal setup is sufficient for most Tailwind projects. PostCSS transforms your CSS before it reaches the browser, ensuring compatibility and enabling Tailwind features.

---

## 2.4 Minimal Next.js Configuration

Next.js provides a powerful configuration file, `next.config.js`, which allows you to customize the build process, enable experimental features, and configure environment variables.

### Example: `next.config.js`

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true, // Helps catch potential issues during development
  swcMinify: true,       // Uses the faster SWC compiler for minification
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,        // Enables the new app directory structure (Next.js 13+)
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

### Explanation:

- `reactStrictMode` enables React’s strict mode, which highlights potential problems in your application.  
- `swcMinify` leverages the Rust-based SWC compiler for faster builds.  
- `experimental.appDir` enables the new Next.js 13+ `app` directory architecture, supporting React Server Components and improved routing.

---

## 2.5 How Configuration Files Influence the Project

These configuration files form the backbone of your styling and build pipeline:

- **Tailwind CSS config (`tailwind.config.ts`)** controls which CSS classes are generated, customizing your design system and ensuring only necessary styles are bundled.  
- **PostCSS config (`postcss.config.js`)** defines how CSS is processed and transformed, ensuring compatibility and enabling Tailwind directives.  
- **Next.js config (`next.config.js`)** customizes the framework’s behavior, enabling features like React strict mode, new routing paradigms, and optimized builds.

Together, these configurations enable a smooth developer experience with:

- Fast build times  
- Predictable styling  
- Modern framework features  
- Maintainable and scalable codebase  

They embody the principle of **configuration as code**, meaning your development environment and build process are reproducible and version-controlled.

---

## 2.6 Conclusion

In this chapter, we set up the foundational configuration for our Next.js project:

- Tailwind CSS configured with JIT mode for efficient styling  
- PostCSS configured to process Tailwind and autoprefix CSS  
- Minimal but effective Next.js config enabling strict mode and the new app directory  

Understanding these configurations is critical before diving into building UI components or integrating features like Google Maps and places autocomplete. With this environment ready, you can confidently implement design and functionality with modern, performant tools.

# Chapter 3: **Building the Root Layout and Global Styling**  

# Chapter 3: Building the Root Layout and Global Styling

In this chapter, we will implement the `RootLayout` component (`app/layout.tsx`), which serves as the foundational layout for our Next.js 13 application. We will explore how layouts work in Next.js 13, how to set important metadata for SEO and Progressive Web App (PWA) support, and how to manage global CSS and font imports. Additionally, we’ll discuss accessibility best practices and introduce global theming to ensure a consistent user experience across the app.

## 3.1 Introduction to Layouts in Next.js 13

Next.js 13 introduces a powerful new `app/` directory structure and a special concept called **layouts**. Unlike traditional pages, layouts are React Server Components that wrap around your pages and other nested layouts, defining a shared UI structure.

### Why use Layouts?

- **Consistent UI**: Layouts allow you to define headers, footers, navigation, or any other persistent UI elements once, and share them across many pages.
- **Performance**: Because layouts are React Server Components, they can fetch data on the server and send fully rendered HTML to the client.
- **Nested Layouts**: You can create layouts at different folder levels, enabling scoped UI and data management.

The `RootLayout` is special because it wraps your entire app, setting the stage for all pages and nested layouts.

---

## 3.2 Creating the RootLayout Component

The root layout lives at `app/layout.tsx`. Here’s a simple example illustrating its structure:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import './globals.css';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-inter',
});

export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Next.js App',
  description: 'An app integrating Google Maps and Places Autocomplete',
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.variable}>
      <head />
      <body>
        {/* Global header can go here */}
        {children}
        {/* Global footer can go here */}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **HTML Structure**: The root layout returns the entire HTML skeleton (`<html>`, `<body>`) required for your app.
- **Font Integration**: We use Next.js’s built-in Google Fonts optimization to load the Inter font and apply it globally using a CSS variable.
- **Metadata**: `metadata` is an exported object Next.js uses to inject SEO-relevant meta tags.
- **`children` Prop**: Represents the nested pages or layouts rendered inside this root layout.

---

## 3.3 Managing Metadata for SEO and PWA

SEO and PWA metadata improve your app’s discoverability and functionality on mobile devices.

### Defining Metadata in Next.js 13

You can export a `metadata` object from your layout or page files containing relevant meta information:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Next.js App',
  description: 'An app integrating Google Maps and Places Autocomplete',
  icons: {
    icon: '/favicon.ico',
    apple: '/apple-touch-icon.png',
  },
  manifest: '/site.webmanifest',
  themeColor: '#317EFB',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'My Next.js App',
    description: 'Google Maps and Places autocomplete integration',
    url: 'https://myapp.example.com',
    siteName: 'Next.js Maps',
    images: [
      {
        url: '/og-image.png',
        width: 1200,
        height: 630,
        alt: 'Next.js Maps',
      },
    ],
    locale: 'en_US',
    type: 'website',
  },
};
```

### What this does:

- **Title and Description**: Shown on search results.
- **Icons and Manifest**: Enables PWA features like "Add to Home Screen."
- **OpenGraph Tags**: Improve link previews on social media.
- **Theme Color**: Sets the browser toolbar color on mobile.

Next.js automatically injects this metadata into the `<head>` of your document.

---

## 3.4 Importing Global CSS and Fonts

In Next.js 13’s `app/` directory, global CSS must be imported at the root layout level (`app/layout.tsx`):

```tsx
import './globals.css';
```

### Why here?

- CSS imported here applies globally, affecting all nested layouts and pages.
- You cannot import global CSS inside components or pages anymore.

### Example: globals.css

```css
/* globals.css */
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: var(--font-inter), sans-serif;
  background-color: #f7f8fa;
  color: #333;
}

a {
  color: #317efb;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### Font Setup

Using Next.js’s built-in Google Fonts integration (via `next/font/google`) helps:

- Optimize font loading.
- Avoid layout shifts.
- Use CSS variables to apply fonts globally.

See the font import example in the `RootLayout` above.

---

## 3.5 Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility (a11y) is essential for building inclusive web apps. When designing your `RootLayout`, consider:

- **Language attribute**: Set `lang="en"` on the `<html>` tag to help screen readers.
- **Skip links**: Provide a "skip to content" link for keyboard users.
- **Focus management**: Ensure focus styles are visible and logical.
- **Contrast and font sizes**: Use accessible color contrasts and readable fonts.

Example of a skip link in the layout:

```tsx
<body>
  <a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
  {children}
</body>
```

And CSS for `.skip-link`:

```css
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 0;
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 8px;
  z-index: 100;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  top: 0;
}
```

---

## 3.6 Implementing Global Theming

In an app integrating Google Maps and autocomplete, consistent theming is crucial.

### Using CSS Variables

Define color palettes and spacing in `globals.css`:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #317efb;
  --color-secondary: #f5f7fa;
  --color-text: #333333;
  --spacing-unit: 8px;
}
```

Use them throughout your app:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--color-secondary);
  color: var(--color-text);
  font-family: var(--font-inter), sans-serif;
}
```

### Using React Context (Optional)

For dynamic theming (e.g., light/dark mode), you can create a React Context provider at the root layout level and pass theme state down.

Example snippet:

```tsx
'use client';

import { createContext, useState } from 'react';

export const ThemeContext = createContext({ theme: 'light', toggleTheme: () => {} });

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  function toggleTheme() {
    setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
  }

  return (
    <html lang="en" data-theme={theme}>
      <body>
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
          {children}
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

And CSS can use `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors to apply dark mode styles.

---

## 3.7 Conclusion

In this chapter, we built the `RootLayout` component, the foundation of our Next.js 13 app. We learned about:

- The new layout system and React Server Components
- How to manage SEO and PWA metadata declaratively
- Importing global CSS and fonts the Next.js 13 way
- Accessibility best practices to make the app usable by all
- Approaches to global theming for consistent styling

With a solid root layout in place, you are now ready to build nested layouts and pages that inherit this shared structure and styling, keeping your app maintainable, performant, and user-friendly.

# Chapter 4: **Implementing Places Autocomplete Input Component**  

# Chapter 4: Implementing Places Autocomplete Input Component

In this chapter, we will build a reusable `PlacesAutocomplete` input component that integrates the Google Places Autocomplete functionality using the `use-places-autocomplete` custom hook. This component will manage the input state, display location suggestions dynamically, and follow accessibility best practices. We will also design the component to communicate with parent components through callback props, enabling flexible and scalable usage across the application.

## Introduction

Autocomplete inputs for places are a common UX pattern in modern web applications, especially those dealing with maps, delivery, or travel features. While Google Maps Places API provides rich autocomplete functionality, integrating it efficiently and accessibly in React requires careful state management and architectural decisions.

The `PlacesAutocomplete` component we build here will:

- Use the `use-places-autocomplete` hook to manage API logic and suggestions  
- Manage the input as a controlled component for predictable behavior  
- Display dynamic suggestions with keyboard and screen reader accessibility  
- Allow parent components to respond to user selections via callbacks  

Let’s dive in!

---

## Setting Up `use-places-autocomplete`

`use-places-autocomplete` is a handy hook that abstracts away the complexity of interacting with the Google Places Autocomplete API. It manages fetching suggestions based on input value and exposes helpful functions and data.

To start, install the package (if not already done):

```bash
npm install use-places-autocomplete
# or
yarn add use-places-autocomplete
```

Inside the component, we initialize it like this:

```tsx
import usePlacesAutocomplete, { getGeocode, getLatLng } from "use-places-autocomplete";

const {
  ready,          // boolean: is the Google API ready
  value,          // string: current input value
  suggestions,    // { status, data } object for autocomplete suggestions
  setValue,       // function to update input value
  clearSuggestions // function to clear suggestions list
} = usePlacesAutocomplete({
  debounce: 300,  // debounce delay for API calls
});
```

- `ready` indicates if the Google Places API is loaded and ready to use.  
- `value` and `setValue` are used to control the input text.  
- `suggestions` contains the status and array of suggested place predictions.  
- `clearSuggestions` clears the suggestion list (usually called once a selection is made).

This hook simplifies most of the heavy lifting involved in managing autocomplete requests and results.

---

## Managing Controlled Input State

React recommends controlled components for form inputs to keep UI state predictable.

In our `PlacesAutocomplete` component, the text input’s value is tied to the hook’s `value` state:

```tsx
<input
  type="text"
  value={value}
  onChange={(e) => {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  }}
  disabled={!ready}
  placeholder="Search a location"
/>
```

- When the user types, `onChange` updates the hook’s internal value via `setValue`.  
- The `disabled` prop disables the input until the Google Places API is ready.  
- The input’s `value` is controlled by the hook, ensuring sync between UI and hook state.

This controlled pattern is essential for predictability, especially when suggestions depend on the input.

---

## Rendering Suggestions and Handling Selection

The `suggestions` object from the hook has the following shape:

```ts
{
  status: "OK" | "ZERO_RESULTS" | ...,
  data: Array<Prediction>
}
```

Each `Prediction` object contains detailed information about a suggested place.

We typically want to display a dropdown list of suggestions as the user types:

```tsx
{suggestions.status === "OK" && (
  <ul>
    {suggestions.data.map(({ place_id, description }) => (
      <li key={place_id} onClick={() => handleSelect(description)}>
        {description}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)}
```

The `handleSelect` function is triggered when the user clicks a suggestion. It should:

1. Update the input value to the selected suggestion  
2. Clear suggestions  
3. Optionally, retrieve detailed info (e.g., lat/lng) using `getGeocode` and `getLatLng` helpers from `use-places-autocomplete`  

Example:

```tsx
const handleSelect = async (address: string) => {
  setValue(address, false); // update input but do not fetch suggestions
  clearSuggestions();

  try {
    const results = await getGeocode({ address });
    const { lat, lng } = await getLatLng(results[0]);
    // Pass lat/lng and address to parent or state
    onSelect({ address, lat, lng });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error getting geocode:", error);
  }
};
```

This approach encapsulates the logic for fetching place details and communicating the final selection to the parent component.

---

## Accessibility Considerations with `useId`

Accessible autocomplete inputs improve the experience for keyboard and screen reader users.

React’s `useId` hook (React 18+) helps generate unique IDs to link the input and the list of suggestions:

```tsx
import { useId } from "react";

const inputId = useId();
const listboxId = `${inputId}-listbox`;
```

In the input element:

```tsx
<input
  id={inputId}
  aria-autocomplete="list"
  aria-controls={listboxId}
  aria-expanded={suggestions.status === "OK"}
  aria-activedescendant={activeId} // dynamically set when navigating suggestions
  ...
/>
```

In the suggestions list:

```tsx
<ul id={listboxId} role="listbox">
  {suggestions.data.map(({ place_id, description }, index) => {
    const optionId = `${listboxId}-option-${index}`;
    return (
      <li
        key={place_id}
        id={optionId}
        role="option"
        aria-selected={activeIndex === index}
        onClick={() => handleSelect(description)}
      >
        {description}
      </li>
    );
  })}
</ul>
```

This markup:

- Connects the input and suggestion list via ARIA attributes  
- Ensures screen readers announce the suggestions properly  
- Supports keyboard navigation when implemented (e.g., arrow keys)

While keyboard navigation is beyond the scope of this chapter, adding `aria-activedescendant` prepares the component for it.

---

## Callback Props for Parent Communication

To keep the component reusable and decoupled, we expose callback props to notify the parent about meaningful events, such as:

- `onSelect`: when the user picks a place (address + lat/lng)  
- `onChange`: when the input value changes (optional, for controlled usage)  
- `onClear`: when suggestions are cleared (optional)

Example prop definitions in TypeScript:

```ts
interface PlacesAutocompleteProps {
  onSelect: (selection: { address: string; lat: number; lng: number }) => void;
  onChange?: (value: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
}
```

Usage inside the component:

```tsx
const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setValue(e.target.value);
  if (onChange) onChange(e.target.value);
};
```

This pattern allows parent components to respond to user input or selection and integrate the autocomplete into different workflows (e.g., forms, map centers, etc.).

---

## Putting It All Together: Complete Component Example

Here is a complete example of the `PlacesAutocomplete` component implementing the concepts discussed:

```tsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";
import usePlacesAutocomplete, { getGeocode, getLatLng } from "use-places-autocomplete";
import { useId } from "react";

interface PlacesAutocompleteProps {
  onSelect: (selection: { address: string; lat: number; lng: number }) => void;
  onChange?: (value: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
}

export const PlacesAutocomplete: React.FC<PlacesAutocompleteProps> = ({
  onSelect,
  onChange,
  placeholder = "Search a location",
}) => {
  const {
    ready,
    value,
    suggestions: { status, data },
    setValue,
    clearSuggestions,
  } = usePlacesAutocomplete({
    debounce: 300,
  });

  const inputId = useId();
  const listboxId = `${inputId}-listbox`;

  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState<number | null>(null);

  const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setValue(e.target.value);
    if (onChange) {
      onChange(e.target.value);
    }
  };

  const handleSelect = async (address: string) => {
    setValue(address, false);
    clearSuggestions();

    try {
      const results = await getGeocode({ address });
      const { lat, lng } = await getLatLng(results[0]);
      onSelect({ address, lat, lng });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching geocode:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
      <input
        id={inputId}
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        disabled={!ready}
        placeholder={placeholder}
        aria-autocomplete="list"
        aria-controls={listboxId}
        aria-expanded={status === "OK"}
        aria-activedescendant={
          activeIndex !== null ? `${listboxId}-option-${activeIndex}` : undefined
        }
        autoComplete="off"
        style={{ width: "100%" }}
      />

      {status === "OK" && data.length > 0 && (
        <ul
          id={listboxId}
          role="listbox"
          style={{
            position: "absolute",
            zIndex: 1000,
            background: "white",
            margin: 0,
            padding: 0,
            listStyle: "none",
            width: "100%",
            maxHeight: "200px",
            overflowY: "auto",
            border: "1px solid #ccc",
          }}
        >
          {data.map(({ place_id, description }, index) => {
            const optionId = `${listboxId}-option-${index}`;
            return (
              <li
                key={place_id}
                id={optionId}
                role="option"
                aria-selected={activeIndex === index}
                onClick={() => handleSelect(description)}
                onMouseEnter={() => setActiveIndex(index)}
                onMouseLeave={() => setActiveIndex(null)}
                style={{
                  padding: "0.5rem",
                  cursor: "pointer",
                  backgroundColor: activeIndex === index ? "#bde4ff" : "transparent",
                }}
              >
                {description}
              </li>
            );
          })}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we created a robust and reusable `PlacesAutocomplete` React component using the `use-places-autocomplete` hook. We covered:

- How to integrate with Google Places API via the hook  
- Managing controlled input state for predictability  
- Rendering and selecting autocomplete suggestions  
- Implementing accessibility best practices using `useId` and ARIA attributes  
- Designing the component with callback props for flexible parent communication  

This component forms a critical UI piece in Next.js apps that require location inputs and can be further enhanced with keyboard navigation, custom styling, and error handling. With this foundation, you can confidently integrate powerful location search functionality into your projects.

# Chapter 5: **Integrating Google Maps with Dynamic Location Rendering**  

# Chapter 5: Integrating Google Maps with Dynamic Location Rendering

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore how to integrate Google Maps into your Next.js application using the `@react-google-maps/api` package. We will focus on the `Home` component (`app/page.tsx`) as a **client component** responsible for managing the map's state, dynamically updating its center based on user input. You will learn how to embed the `GoogleMap` and `MarkerF` components, how to geocode addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates using `getGeocode` and `getLatLng` utilities, and how to reflect these changes dynamically on the map.

By the end of this chapter, you will understand the fundamentals behind declarative Google Maps rendering within a React environment, the significance of client components in Next.js 13+, and how to manage state effectively with hooks like `useState`.

---

## 5.1 Setting Up the `Home` Component as a Client Component

Next.js 13 introduced React Server Components by default. However, to manage interactive state or browser-only APIs (like Google Maps), we need to designate components as **client components**. This is done by adding `"use client";` at the top of the file.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { GoogleMap, MarkerF, useLoadScript } from "@react-google-maps/api";

// Additional imports will be covered later
```

### Why `"use client";`?

- Enables React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` that require client-side rendering.
- Allows interaction with browser APIs (e.g., Google Maps JavaScript API).
- Essential for components needing dynamic updates and user interaction.

---

## 5.2 Managing Map State with `useState`

The core of dynamic location rendering lies in maintaining the map's center coordinates in state so that when a user searches or selects a new location, the map re-centers automatically.

We typically start with a default location, for example, New York City coordinates:

```tsx
const DEFAULT_CENTER = { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.006 };
```

Inside the `Home` component, declare state for the map center:

```tsx
const [center, setCenter] = useState<{ lat: number; lng: number }>(DEFAULT_CENTER);
```

This `center` state will be passed to the `GoogleMap` component to control its viewport.

---

## 5.3 Embedding Google Map and Marker Components

The `@react-google-maps/api` package provides declarative React components to work with Google Maps. Two key components are:

- **`GoogleMap`**: The map container.
- **`MarkerF`**: A marker on the map (the `F` variant supports React 18's concurrent features).

### Loading the Google Maps Script

Before rendering the map, you must load the Google Maps API script using the `useLoadScript` hook:

```tsx
const { isLoaded, loadError } = useLoadScript({
  googleMapsApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY || "",
  libraries: ["places"], // if you use Places Autocomplete or Geocoding services
});
```

### Rendering the Map and Marker

```tsx
if (loadError) return <div>Error loading maps</div>;
if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading Maps...</div>;

return (
  <GoogleMap
    zoom={14}
    center={center}
    mapContainerStyle={{ width: "100%", height: "400px" }}
  >
    <MarkerF position={center} />
  </GoogleMap>
);
```

This renders a map centered at `center` with a marker positioned exactly there.

---

## 5.4 Geocoding Addresses to Coordinates

To dynamically update the map center based on user input (e.g., an address), we need to convert addresses into latitude and longitude. This process is called **geocoding**.

### Using `getGeocode` and `getLatLng`

The `@react-google-maps/api` package exports utility functions to help with geocoding:

- **`getGeocode({ address })`**: Takes a string address and returns geocode results.
- **`getLatLng(geocodeResult)`**: Extracts `{ lat, lng }` from a geocode result.

### Example: Geocode an Address and Update the Map

Here is an example function inside the `Home` component that takes an address string, geocodes it, and updates the map center state:

```tsx
import { getGeocode, getLatLng } from "use-places-autocomplete";

async function handleAddressSelect(address: string) {
  try {
    const results = await getGeocode({ address });
    if (results.length === 0) throw new Error("No results found");
    const { lat, lng } = await getLatLng(results[0]);
    setCenter({ lat, lng });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error geocoding address:", error);
  }
}
```

You can call `handleAddressSelect` whenever the user selects or inputs a new address.

---

## 5.5 Putting It All Together: Complete `Home` Component Example

Below is a simplified but complete example of the `Home` component integrating all the pieces:

```tsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { GoogleMap, MarkerF, useLoadScript } from "@react-google-maps/api";
import { getGeocode, getLatLng } from "use-places-autocomplete";

const DEFAULT_CENTER = { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.006 };

export default function Home() {
  const [center, setCenter] = useState(DEFAULT_CENTER);
  const [address, setAddress] = useState("");

  const { isLoaded, loadError } = useLoadScript({
    googleMapsApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY || "",
    libraries: ["places"],
  });

  async function handleSearch() {
    if (!address) return;
    try {
      const results = await getGeocode({ address });
      if (results.length === 0) throw new Error("No results found");
      const { lat, lng } = await getLatLng(results[0]);
      setCenter({ lat, lng });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to geocode address:", error);
    }
  }

  if (loadError) return <div>Error loading maps</div>;
  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading Maps...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Enter address"
        value={address}
        onChange={(e) => setAddress(e.target.value)}
        style={{ width: "300px", padding: "8px" }}
      />
      <button onClick={handleSearch} style={{ marginLeft: "10px" }}>
        Search
      </button>

      <GoogleMap
        zoom={14}
        center={center}
        mapContainerStyle={{ width: "100%", height: "400px", marginTop: "20px" }}
      >
        <MarkerF position={center} />
      </GoogleMap>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- The component initializes with a default center.
- An input field allows users to enter an address.
- Upon clicking **Search**, `handleSearch` geocodes the address and updates the map center.
- The map and marker re-render automatically based on the updated `center` state.

---

## 5.6 Summary and Best Practices

- **Client Components:** Always declare `"use client";` when using hooks or browser APIs.
- **State Management:** Use `useState` to track dynamic values like map center coordinates.
- **Declarative Map Rendering:** Use `GoogleMap` and `MarkerF` components from `@react-google-maps/api` to declaratively render maps and markers.
- **Geocoding Utilities:** Leverage `getGeocode` and `getLatLng` for converting addresses to lat/lng coordinates.
- **Error Handling:** Always handle errors gracefully, especially for user inputs and external API calls.

---

## Conclusion

Integrating Google Maps with dynamic location rendering enhances the user experience by providing interactive, real-time map updates. By managing the map state within a client component and utilizing declarative APIs, you can create responsive and intuitive map features in your Next.js application.

In the next chapter, we will build upon this foundation by integrating places autocomplete functionality to improve address input and selection, creating a seamless location search experience.

# Chapter 6: **Data Flow and Component Interaction**  

# Chapter 6: Data Flow and Component Interaction

## Introduction

In this chapter, we dive deep into the data flow and interaction between components in our Next.js application that integrates Google Maps with a Places Autocomplete feature. Understanding how information travels from user input through to the map rendering is crucial for grasping the architecture and design principles behind this project.

We will explore how the `PlacesAutocomplete` component communicates the selected address back to the parent `Home` component, triggering geocoding and map updates. Along the way, we will discuss the concept of unidirectional data flow in React, parent-child communication patterns, event handling, and the separation of concerns that keeps the codebase maintainable and scalable.

---

## 1. Overview of the Data Flow

At a high level, the data flow in this application follows React’s unidirectional data flow paradigm:

1. **User Input:** The user types an address in the `PlacesAutocomplete` input field.
2. **Selection Event:** When the user selects an address from the autocomplete suggestions, `PlacesAutocomplete` emits a callback with the selected address.
3. **Parent Update:** The `Home` component receives this address via a callback prop and triggers geocoding to obtain latitude and longitude.
4. **State Update:** `Home` updates its state with the new coordinates.
5. **Map Rendering:** The updated state is passed down to the map component (e.g., Google Maps React component), which renders the map centered at the new location.

This flow ensures data moves downward via props and events bubble upward via callbacks, maintaining a clear and predictable interaction pattern.

---

## 2. Components Involved

### `PlacesAutocomplete`

- **Role:** Provides an input box with autocomplete suggestions powered by Google Places API.
- **Output:** Selected address string.
- **Communication:** Uses a callback prop (e.g., `onSelect`) to notify the parent when an address is selected.

### `Home`

- **Role:** Acts as the container and orchestrator.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Holds the selected address and coordinates in its state.
  - Handles geocoding the selected address to coordinates.
  - Passes coordinates to the map component for rendering.

### Map Component (e.g., `GoogleMap`)

- **Role:** Receives coordinates as props and renders the map centered on those coordinates.

---

## 3. Parent-Child Communication in Action

### Passing Callbacks Down and Events Up

In React, data flows down from parent to child via props, while children communicate events up to parents via callback functions passed as props. This pattern is clear in how `Home` and `PlacesAutocomplete` interact.

#### Example: `Home` Passing Callback to `PlacesAutocomplete`

```tsx
// Home.tsx (simplified)

import { useState } from 'react';
import PlacesAutocomplete from './PlacesAutocomplete';

export default function Home() {
  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');
  const [coordinates, setCoordinates] = useState({ lat: 0, lng: 0 });

  // Callback to receive selected address from PlacesAutocomplete
  const handleSelect = async (selectedAddress: string) => {
    setAddress(selectedAddress);

    // Geocode address to get lat/lng
    const coords = await geocodeAddress(selectedAddress);
    setCoordinates(coords);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <PlacesAutocomplete onSelect={handleSelect} />
      <MapComponent center={coordinates} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, `Home` passes down the `handleSelect` function as the `onSelect` prop to `PlacesAutocomplete`. When the user selects a place, `PlacesAutocomplete` calls this function with the selected address.

### `PlacesAutocomplete` Calling the Callback

```tsx
// PlacesAutocomplete.tsx (simplified)

type Props = {
  onSelect: (address: string) => void;
};

export default function PlacesAutocomplete({ onSelect }: Props) {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handlePlaceSelect = (address: string) => {
    setInputValue(address);
    onSelect(address);  // Notify parent
  };

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={inputValue}
      onChange={e => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      // Autocomplete logic omitted for brevity
      onBlur={() => handlePlaceSelect(inputValue)}
    />
  );
}
```

`PlacesAutocomplete` manages its own input state but notifies the parent when an address is selected via the `onSelect` callback.

---

## 4. Geocoding and Map Updates

Once the `Home` component receives the selected address, it needs to translate it into geographical coordinates to update the map.

### Geocoding Function

A typical approach is to use the Google Maps Geocoding API:

```ts
async function geocodeAddress(address: string): Promise<{ lat: number; lng: number }> {
  const geocoder = new window.google.maps.Geocoder();
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    geocoder.geocode({ address }, (results, status) => {
      if (status === 'OK' && results?.[0]) {
        const location = results[0].geometry.location;
        resolve({ lat: location.lat(), lng: location.lng() });
      } else {
        reject(new Error('Geocoding failed'));
      }
    });
  });
}
```

### Updating State and Re-rendering Map

After geocoding, `Home` updates its state with the new coordinates, which causes React to re-render the map component centered on the updated location.

```tsx
<MapComponent center={coordinates} />
```

---

## 5. Separation of Concerns

The design follows the principle of **separation of concerns**:

- `PlacesAutocomplete` focuses strictly on user input and address selection.
- `Home` is responsible for managing state, performing geocoding, and orchestrating the overall flow.
- The map component is only concerned with rendering the map given coordinates.

This separation ensures components remain reusable and easier to maintain.

---

## 6. Unidirectional Data Flow Benefits

- **Predictability:** Data always flows downward, making the app’s state easier to track.
- **Debuggability:** Since state changes happen in one place (`Home`), debugging is straightforward.
- **Scalability:** New features or components can be added without breaking existing data flow patterns.

---

## Conclusion

Understanding the data flow and component interaction is essential for working effectively with this Next.js Google Maps integration. The clear unidirectional data flow — user input in `PlacesAutocomplete` → callback to `Home` → geocoding → state update → map rendering — demonstrates React’s best practices for parent-child communication and separation of concerns.

By adhering to these patterns, the codebase remains clean, modular, and scalable, making it easier for developers to extend functionality or debug issues as the project grows.

# Chapter 7: **Styling Components with Tailwind CSS**  

# Chapter 7: Styling Components with Tailwind CSS

In this chapter, we’ll explore how to leverage **Tailwind CSS** to style your Next.js components effectively. Tailwind provides a utility-first approach to CSS, allowing you to rapidly build responsive and customizable interfaces without leaving your markup. We will cover applying Tailwind utility classes throughout the components in our project, extending Tailwind’s default theme for customization, optimizing styles by purging unused CSS for performance, and combining Tailwind with component logic to achieve dynamic styling.

---

## 7.1 Introduction to Tailwind CSS in Our Project

Tailwind CSS is already configured in this Next.js repository, providing a rich set of utility classes that can be directly applied to JSX elements. This approach aligns well with React’s component-driven paradigm, enabling you to style elements inline with clean, semantic markup.

Using Tailwind, you can:

- Build **responsive layouts** with minimal effort using breakpoint prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.).
- Customize colors, fonts, spacing, and more by extending Tailwind’s default theme.
- Write **dynamic styles** that respond to component state or props.
- Optimize your final CSS bundle by purging unused styles, improving load times.

---

## 7.2 Applying Tailwind Utility Classes in Components

Tailwind’s core strength lies in applying small, composable utility classes directly on elements.

### Example: Styling a Search Input with Autocomplete

Suppose we have a `SearchInput.tsx` component that integrates Google Places Autocomplete. Here’s a typical example of applying Tailwind classes:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface SearchInputProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (val: string) => void;
}

const SearchInput: React.FC<SearchInputProps> = ({ value, onChange }) => {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={value}
      onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Search places..."
      className="
        w-full
        px-4
        py-2
        border
        border-gray-300
        rounded-md
        focus:outline-none
        focus:ring-2
        focus:ring-blue-500
        transition
        duration-150
        ease-in-out
        "
    />
  );
};

export default SearchInput;
```

#### Explanation:

- `w-full`: Makes the input span the full width of its container.
- `px-4 py-2`: Adds horizontal and vertical padding.
- `border border-gray-300 rounded-md`: Adds a subtle border with rounded corners.
- `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`: Adds a blue ring on focus for accessibility and visual feedback.
- `transition duration-150 ease-in-out`: Smooth animation on focus changes.

### Responsive Styling Example

To make components adapt to different screen sizes, use Tailwind’s responsive prefixes:

```tsx
<div className="p-4 sm:p-6 md:p-8 lg:p-10">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

- Padding increases with larger breakpoints: `p-4` by default, `p-6` on small screens (`sm`), and so forth.

---

## 7.3 Extending Tailwind Themes and Customization

While Tailwind comes with a sensible default theme, you often want to add project-specific colors, fonts, or spacing scales. This is done in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Example: Adding Custom Colors

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brandBlue: '#1DA1F2',
        brandGray: '#657786',
      },
      spacing: {
        '72': '18rem',
        '84': '21rem',
      },
    },
  },
  // other config options...
};
```

Now, in your components, you can use these custom utilities:

```tsx
<button className="bg-brandBlue text-white px-6 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  Search
</button>
```

### Why Extend?

- **Consistency:** Maintain a design system with consistent colors and spacing.
- **Scalability:** Easily update styles globally by modifying the config.
- **Reusability:** Avoid repeating raw values across your codebase.

---

## 7.4 Purging Unused Styles for Performance

Tailwind generates a large CSS file by default, but Next.js and Tailwind’s standard setup include a purge step to remove unused styles in production.

### How It Works

- Tailwind scans your source files (`.tsx`, `.js`, `.html`, etc.) looking for class names.
- Any classes not found in your source are removed from the final CSS bundle.
- This drastically reduces the CSS size, improving page load times.

### Configuration Example

In `tailwind.config.js`, the `content` field specifies which files Tailwind should scan:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',  // Next.js 13 app directory
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    // add other folders as needed
  ],
  // ...
};
```

### Tips for Purging

- Avoid dynamically constructing class names as strings since Tailwind cannot detect them.
- Use libraries like [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) or [`classnames`](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) to conditionally apply classes safely.

---

## 7.5 Combining Tailwind with Component Logic for Dynamic Styling

Tailwind works great with JavaScript logic to dynamically toggle styles based on component state or props.

### Example: Dynamic Button Disabled State

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import clsx from 'clsx';

interface ButtonProps {
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ disabled, onClick, children }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
      className={clsx(
        'px-4 py-2 rounded font-semibold transition-colors duration-150',
        disabled
          ? 'bg-gray-300 cursor-not-allowed text-gray-600'
          : 'bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white'
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

#### Explanation:

- We use `clsx` to conditionally apply classes based on the `disabled` prop.
- When disabled, the button has muted colors and a not-allowed cursor.
- When enabled, it shows vibrant blue and supports hover styles.

### Example: Responsive Layout with Conditional Classes

```tsx
<div className={clsx('p-4', isMobile ? 'bg-white' : 'bg-gray-100')}>
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

This enables combining Tailwind’s utility classes with React’s powerful logic for flexible UI.

## Introduction

Building an interactive map application with autocomplete functionality requires careful attention to how users interact with the UI, how smoothly the app performs, and how easy the codebase is to maintain. Accessibility ensures inclusivity, performance optimization improves user experience and reduces costs, and maintainability helps your team iterate faster and avoid bugs.

---

## Accessibility Best Practices

Accessibility (a11y) means designing and building your application so that it is usable by people with a wide range of abilities, including those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation. Here are key accessibility considerations in this codebase.

### Stable IDs

When working with components like autocomplete dropdowns or lists, stable, unique IDs are crucial for associating labels, inputs, and ARIA attributes correctly.

```tsx
// Example: Using stable IDs for input and list association
const inputId = "location-autocomplete-input";
const listboxId = "location-autocomplete-listbox";

return (
  <>
    <label htmlFor={inputId}>Location</label>
    <input
      id={inputId}
      aria-autocomplete="list"
      aria-controls={listboxId}
      aria-expanded={isOpen}
      onChange={handleChange}
      // other props
    />
    {isOpen && (
      <ul id={listboxId} role="listbox">
        {suggestions.map((suggestion, index) => (
          <li key={suggestion.place_id} role="option" aria-selected={index === highlightedIndex}>
            {suggestion.description}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}
  </>
);
```

- **Why?** Screen readers rely on these IDs to map between inputs and their options. Using a consistent ID pattern helps maintain this relationship.

### Keyboard Navigation

Users may not always use a mouse. Keyboard navigation is essential for accessibility:

- **Focus management:** Ensure users can navigate through inputs and dropdown options using `Tab`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `Enter`, and `Escape` keys.
- **Highlighting:** Visually and programmatically highlight the currently focused option.
- **Event handling:** Properly handle key events to move focus and select options.

```tsx
const handleKeyDown = (event: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  switch (event.key) {
    case "ArrowDown":
      event.preventDefault();
      setHighlightedIndex((prev) => Math.min(prev + 1, suggestions.length - 1));
      break;
    case "ArrowUp":
      event.preventDefault();
      setHighlightedIndex((prev) => Math.max(prev - 1, 0));
      break;
    case "Enter":
      event.preventDefault();
      if (highlightedIndex >= 0) {
        selectSuggestion(suggestions[highlightedIndex]);
      }
      break;
    case "Escape":
      setIsOpen(false);
      break;
  }
};
```

- **Tip:** Use `aria-activedescendant` to link the input with the active option for screen readers.

### ARIA Attributes and Screen Reader Support

ARIA attributes provide semantic meaning to UI elements that are not naturally accessible.

- Use `role="combobox"` for the input container.
- Use `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, and `aria-controls` to indicate dropdown state.
- Use `role="listbox"` for the dropdown container and `role="option"` for each item.
- Mark the selected option with `aria-selected="true"`.

```tsx
<input
  role="combobox"
  aria-autocomplete="list"
  aria-expanded={isOpen}
  aria-controls={listboxId}
  aria-activedescendant={highlightedOptionId}
/>
<ul role="listbox" id={listboxId}>
  {suggestions.map((option, index) => (
    <li
      id={`option-${index}`}
      role="option"
      aria-selected={index === highlightedIndex}
      key={option.place_id}
    >
      {option.description}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

## Performance Optimization

Performance is critical for user experience, especially with interactive maps and autocomplete that rely on external API calls and dynamic rendering.

### Memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`

React's `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks help avoid unnecessary recalculations and re-renders:

- Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive computations or derived data.
- Use `useCallback` to memoize functions passed as props to child components to avoid triggering re-renders.

```tsx
const memoizedSuggestions = useMemo(() => {
  return suggestions.filter((s) => s.description.toLowerCase().includes(inputValue.toLowerCase()));
}, [suggestions, inputValue]);

const handleSelect = useCallback((suggestion) => {
  setSelectedSuggestion(suggestion);
}, []);
```

- **Why important?** Without memoization, every render could cause expensive computations or re-create functions, negatively impacting performance.

### Minimal Next.js Configuration Reliance

- Avoid heavy or unnecessary Next.js customizations unless essential.
- Use built-in features like API routes, incremental static regeneration (ISR), and image optimization wisely.
- Keep configuration minimal to reduce build time and complexity.

For example, rely on Next.js’s default Webpack config and only add custom plugins/loaders when necessary.

### Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

- Dynamically import heavy components or third-party libraries (like Google Maps scripts) only when needed.
- Use Next.js dynamic imports with SSR disabled for client-only components.

```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const Map = dynamic(() => import("../components/Map"), { ssr: false });
```

- This reduces initial bundle size and speeds up page load.

## Maintainability and Scalability

A codebase integrating external APIs and complex UI interactions can become hard to maintain without good practices.

### Clean Separation of Concerns

- Separate UI components, API interaction code, and utility functions.
- Use hooks to encapsulate logic (e.g., a custom `usePlacesAutocomplete` hook).
- Avoid large "god" components by splitting features into smaller, reusable pieces.

Example folder structure:

```
/components
  /Autocomplete
  /Map
/hooks
  usePlacesAutocomplete.ts
/lib
  google-maps.ts
/pages
  index.tsx
```

### Handling External API Integrations

- Abstract API calls into reusable functions or custom hooks.
- Handle API keys securely via environment variables (`process.env`).
- Implement error handling and loading states gracefully.
- Cache responses when possible to reduce redundant network calls.

```tsx
// Example custom hook for Places Autocomplete
function usePlacesAutocomplete(input: string) {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!input) return;

    const service = new window.google.maps.places.AutocompleteService();
    service.getPlacePredictions({ input }, (predictions, status) => {
      if (status === window.google.maps.places.PlacesServiceStatus.OK) {
        setResults(predictions);
      } else {
        setResults([]);
      }
    });
  }, [input]);

  return results;
}
```

### Consistent Hook Usage and State Management

- Follow React hooks best practices:
  - Only call hooks at the top level.
  - Use custom hooks to share logic.
- Manage state locally when possible; use context or state management libraries only if necessary.
- Keep state minimal and normalized to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
